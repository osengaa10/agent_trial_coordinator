The patient has soft tissue sarcoma that started in the stomach and spread to the liver, which meets the eligibility criteria for this clinical trial. The contact information for this clinical trial is Kavita Vadali, Global Clinical Trials, Telix Pharma, phone: +61 3 9093 3808, email: global-clinicaltrials@telixpharma.com. The patient is a good fit for this clinical trial because they have soft tissue sarcoma, which is a solid tumor, and the clinical trial is studying the use of 89Zr-girentuximab for PET imaging of solid tumors likely to express high levels of CAIX.

Tool used: human
Tool input: {"question": "What is the patient's health issue?"}

Action log: I need to review the clinical trials and determine which ones the patient would be eligible for and which ones would be the best fit based on their condition. I will start by reviewing the first clinical trial.

Action: human
Action Input: {"question": "What is the patient's health issue?"}

Description: A relatively aggressive sarcoma that started in the stomach and spread to the liver. The patient is a 32 year old male.
--------------------------------------------------
-6----AgentFinish---------------------------------------
Agent Name: ===coordinator_agent===
AgentFinish Output: The best clinical trial for the patient is the Feasibility Trial of Preoperative 5-Day Hypofractionated Radiotherapy for Primary Soft Tissue Sarcoma. The patient meets all of the eligibility criteria and the intervention could be a good fit for their condition as it is a form of radiation therapy followed by surgery. The second clinical trial, Genomic Profiles Analysis in Children, Adolescents and Young Adult With Sarcomas (SAR-GEN_ITA): a Multicenter Prospective Study, is not a good fit for the patient as they do not meet the age criteria. The final answer is the actual complete content as the final answer, not a summary.
