- Exclusion Criteria: Prior treatment with doxorubicin or ifosfamide, Pregnant or breastfeeding women, Active infection

The patient meets the inclusion criteria for this trial and has not received prior treatment with doxorubicin or ifosfamide. The trial is a Phase III study evaluating the efficacy of doxorubicin and ifosfamide in treating soft tissue sarcoma. The patient may be a potential candidate for this trial.

AgentFinish Output: 1. Title: A Phase III Randomized Study of Soft Tissue Sarcoma
   - This clinical trial is a phase III study evaluating the efficacy of doxorubicin and ifosfamide in treating soft tissue sarcoma. The patient meets the inclusion criteria for this trial and has not received prior treatment with doxorubicin or ifosfamide. The patient must have histologically confirmed soft tissue sarcoma, measurable disease, be at least 18 years old, have an ECOG performance status of ≤ 2, and have adequate organ function. The patient must also not have any active infections, be pregnant, or breastfeeding.
