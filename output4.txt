In the first 4 weeks of enrollment, the patients were treated with field expanding radiotherapy (ef-rt) or the limited field radiotherapy designed to evaluate tumor lesions in the first 2 weeks of enrollment.\n    * Accompanied by pleural effusion or ascites, causing respiratory syndrome (CTCAE grade 2 dyspnea [grade 2 dyspnea refers to shortness of breath when there is a small amount of activity; it affects instrumental daily life activities]);\n    * Unrelieved toxic reactions caused by any previous treatment higher than CTCAE (4.1) level 1 or above, excluding hair loss;\n    * Patients with multiple factors (such as inability to swallow, chronic diarrhea and intestinal obstruction) affecting oral drugs;\n    * Patients with brain metastases with symptoms or with symptoms for less than 2 months;\n    * Patients with any severe and/or uncontrolled disease, including:\n\n    Contact Information:\n    Clinical Trials - CONTACT\n    Phone: (877) 544-6728, Email: clinicaltrials@igmbio.com\n\n    Conditions:\n    Solid Tumor, Colorectal Cancer, Non Hodgkin Lymphoma, Sarcoma, Chondrosarcoma, Small Lymphocytic Lymphoma, Chronic Lymphocytic Leukemia, Acute Myeloid Leukemia\n\n    Interventions:\n    DRUG - Aplitabart (IGM-8444): DR5 Agonist Investigational Drug\n    DRUG - FOLFIRI: Chemotherapy Regimen\n    DRUG - Bevacizumab (and approved biosimilars): Targeted Therapy\n    DRUG - Birinapant: SMAC-mimetic Investigational Drug\n    DRUG - Venetoclax: Targeted Therapy\n    DRUG - Gemcitabine: Chemotherapy\n    DRUG - Docetaxel: Chemotherapy\n    DRUG - Azacitidine: Chemotherapy\n\nPlease note that these are potential fits for the patient and the Clinical Trials Coordinator should verify the trial's status and eligibility criteria before recommending it to the patient.")]}
